Echo Swirl is an entry for a game jam named [CUSGA2024](https://www.ciga.me/cusga), which mixes the mechanics of a rhythm game and a 2d-platform game.

In other terms, it's also a project for me to practice game development with Unity and some coding abilities.

# Status

This project is still in development and unfinished.

**ToDo-List / Future-Plan**
- warning light in both side of the screen on low health (intensity can be increased), with some audio filter(low-pass or high-pass).
- replay of single level's gameplay (like osu!mania), progress can be setup manually.
- link-play or live-comment on gameplay.
